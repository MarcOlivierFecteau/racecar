# Restore RaspberryPi image
1. Download the following SD-CARD image for RPI4 (created following this [section](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#create-raspberrypi-image) below):
    * RPI4: [racecar_ros2_ubuntu22 1](https://tinyurl.com/RacecarRos2Ubuntu2204) (5.05GB)
2. Use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the image on a SD-CARD (min 16GB). 
3. Boot the RPI with HDMI, a mouse and a keyboard connected. Default username is `racecar` and password is `racecar`. 
4. (Optional) Resize partition to use the full SD-CARD.
    1. Open terminal.
    2. `sudo gparted`, enter password `racecar`.
    3. Right-click on the main partition (`/dev/mmcblk0p2`), then click "Resize/Move" in the menu.
    4. Set 0 in "Free space following", then click on "Resize".
    5. Click on "Apply".
    
5. To [connect by ethernet or hotspot](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/doc), as your RPI has different hardware, you may have to update the ethernet and hotspot connections with the right device if not working already out-of-the-box. In Network Manager (top right), click on "Edit Connectionsâ€¦". 
    1. Edit "Wired connection 192.168.10.1". Under "Ethernet" panel, select device with "eth0", then save. Remove "Wired connection 1" if it exists.
    2. Edit "Hotspot 10.42.0.1". Under "Wi-Fi" panel, select device with "wlan0", then save. Change SSID name of the connection with ID of your racecar. The default password `racecar0` can also be changed. 

6. Make sure to have latest code. Normally we would do:
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/racecar
    $ git pull
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws
    $ catkin_make
    ```
    * Note to have Internet on the RaceCar: disconnect from the Hotspot connection and select your preferred Wi-Fi network. To do so remotely, use VNC with the Ethernet connection, then change the Wi-Fi network.
